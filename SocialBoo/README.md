# Social Boo

Social boo demonstrates a simple Social style application UI based on a template of the same name from [app design vault](http://www.appdesignvault.com/shop/social-boo/). This demo uses a somewhat outdated but still reasonable gunmetal look, it also features different UI styles when running on a tablet/phone.

E.g. notice in the screenshot below that the UI for the demo differs when running in a phone/tablet and even changes when the tablet flips between portrait and landscape...

This demo was originally developed for the old GUI builder and was adapted to use the new GUI builder in this iteration. We chose to leave the original design in place "as is" since it demonstrates how deeply Codename One can be customized with very little work.

Check out the [full demo page](https://www.codenameone.com/demos-SocialBoo.html) on the Codename One site.

You can run the native demo on an Android device with [this APK](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/SocialBoo/SocialBoo-release.apk) and also check out the live [in browser version](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/SocialBoo) of the demo. The latter uses the Codename One JavaScript port to build the unmodified demo into a web app.
